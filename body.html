                <h2>a. Importance of Nonverbal Communication:</h2>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nonverbal communication, including body language, plays a crucial role in how you are
                        perceived
                        by the interviewer.</li>
                    <li>It can convey confidence, interest, and engagement, or it can undermine your message if it
                        displays nervousness or disinterest.</li>
                    <li>Remember that your nonverbal cues should align with your verbal responses and demonstrate
                        your
                        genuine enthusiasm for the opportunity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                <h2>b. Maintaining Good Posture:</h2>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sit upright and maintain good posture throughout the interview. Slouching or leaning back
                        excessively can make you appear uninterested or lacking confidence.</li>
                    <li>Men should be clean-shaven or keep facial hair well-groomed and trimmed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Keep your back straight, shoulders relaxed, and head held high. This posture conveys
                        attentiveness and professionalism.</li>
                    <li>Avoid crossing your arms, as it can create a barrier and make you seem defensive or closed
                        off. Instead, keep your arms relaxed and your hands comfortably placed on your lap or the
                        armrests of the chair.</li>


                </ul>
                <p>
                <h2>c. Firm Handshake:</h2>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When greeting the interviewer, offer a firm and confident handshake.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that your handshake is neither too limp nor too aggressive. Aim for a moderate grip
                        that demonstrates your confidence without overpowering the other person's hand.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make eye contact and smile while shaking hands to show sincerity and engagement.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                <h2>d. Using Appropriate Facial Expressions:</h2>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your facial expressions can convey a range of emotions and attitudes. Maintain a pleasant
                        and friendly expression throughout the interview.</li>
                    <li>Smile genuinely when appropriate, such as when greeting the interviewer or during moments of
                        positive conversation. This conveys warmth and approachability.
                    </li>
                    <li>Be mindful of maintaining a neutral or interested expression when the conversation takes on
                        a more serious or professional tone. Avoid excessive or inappropriate facial expressions
                        that may distract or give the wrong impression.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                <h2>e. Avoiding Distracting Habits:</h2>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be conscious of any distracting habits or tics that you may have, such as playing with your
                        hair, tapping your fingers, or excessive fidgeting.</li>
                    <li>These behaviors can be perceived as signs of nervousness or lack of focus. Stay aware of
                        your movements and consciously keep them under control.
                    </li>
                    <li>Maintain steady eye contact with the interviewer to convey confidence and engagement.
                        However, be sure to balance eye contact without making the interviewer uncomfortable or
                        appearing too intense.</li>
